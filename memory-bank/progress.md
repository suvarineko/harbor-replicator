[2025-06-09 15:26:18] - Created comprehensive Product Requirements Document for Harbor Registry Replicator application with the following key sections:
- Executive Summary outlining the synchronization solution
- Detailed functional requirements for robot accounts and OIDC groups synchronization
- Technical architecture using Go with Harbor go-client v0.210.0
- Complete configuration schema with YAML structure
- Docker Compose and Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Testing strategy covering unit, integration, performance, and security testing
- Success metrics for technical, operational, and business outcomes
- Risk mitigation strategies and future enhancement roadmap

The PRD emphasizes name-based resource identification to handle Harbor's unique ID challenges and includes comprehensive error handling and monitoring requirements.

[2025-06-09 19:46:20] - ## Tasks 1-3 Implementation Progress

Successfully implemented Tasks 1-3 including all subtasks:

**Task 1 - Initialize Go Project Structure** ‚úÖ
- Created complete Go module structure with proper directories
- Implemented Makefile with build, test, and development commands
- Set up .gitignore for Go projects
- Created main.go entry point with signal handling

**Task 2 - Implement Configuration Manager (8 subtasks)** ‚úÖ
- Task 2.1: Comprehensive configuration data structures with YAML/env mappings
- Task 2.2: Viper-based configuration loading with defaults and environment support
- Task 2.3: Robust validation with detailed error messages and field validation
- Task 2.4: File watching and hot-reload capabilities with fsnotify
- Task 2.5: Configuration manager service with subscriber pattern
- Task 2.6: Advanced environment variable substitution with defaults and caching
- Task 2.7: Configuration export/import utilities supporting YAML/JSON with secret masking
- Task 2.8: Complete documentation with minimal, production, and development configs

**Task 3 - Harbor Client Wrapper (4 of 10 subtasks completed)** üü°
- Task 3.1: Defined comprehensive client interfaces and types ‚úÖ
- Task 3.2: HTTP transport with connection pooling and TLS support ‚úÖ
- Task 3.3: Rate limiter with adaptive and per-endpoint capabilities ‚úÖ
- Task 3.4: Circuit breaker pattern implementation (in progress) ‚è≥

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- Structured logging with zap and field sanitization
- Comprehensive configuration management with hot-reload
- Production-ready HTTP transport layer
- Rate limiting with burst control and adaptive behavior
- Type-safe configuration with validation
- Environment variable substitution with fallbacks

**Next Steps:**
- Complete remaining Task 3 subtasks (3.4-3.10)
- Implement error handling and retry logic
- Build core Harbor client wrapper
- Add Robot Account and OIDC operations
- Integrate metrics and health checks

[2025-06-10 17:13:56] - ## Session Progress - Task 3 Implementation Continued

Successfully continued implementation of Task 3 (Harbor Client Wrapper) and completed subtasks 3.4-3.8:

**Completed in this session:**

**Task 3.4 - Circuit Breaker Pattern** ‚úÖ
- Implemented comprehensive circuit breaker middleware with states (closed, open, half-open)
- Added failure tracking, threshold management, and automatic recovery
- Integrated with HTTP transport layer and metrics collection
- Created multi-circuit breaker support for different operations

**Task 3.5 - Error Handling and Retry Logic** ‚úÖ
- Built comprehensive error categorization system (transient, permanent, network, auth, etc.)
- Implemented exponential backoff retry logic with jitter
- Created custom Harbor error types with retry behavior
- Added retry middleware for HTTP requests with configurable strategies

**Task 3.6 - Core Harbor Client Wrapper** ‚úÖ
- Implemented main HarborClientWrapper that integrates all middleware components
- Added authentication, connection validation, and configuration management
- Built HTTP client with middleware stack (circuit breaker, rate limiter, retry)
- Included health checks, statistics tracking, and observability hooks

**Task 3.7 - Robot Account Operations** ‚úÖ
- Implemented full CRUD operations for system and project-level robot accounts
- Added pagination support, search functionality, and validation helpers
- Built permission management and project association logic
- Included comprehensive error handling and logging

**Task 3.8 - OIDC Group Operations** ‚úÖ
- Implemented OIDC group management with full CRUD operations
- Added project association management (add/remove groups from projects)
- Built role management and permission hierarchy handling
- Included validation helpers and group type detection

**Technical Achievements:**
- Updated config types to support additional transport and TLS settings
- Fixed compilation issues and import optimization
- Maintained consistent error handling patterns across all components
- Applied structured logging throughout all operations

**Remaining Tasks:**
- Task 3.9: Metrics and Observability (pending)
- Task 3.10: Health Check and Diagnostics (pending)
- Tasks 4-6: State Manager, Robot Sync, and OIDC Sync implementations

**Next Steps:**
The Harbor client wrapper foundation is now complete with all core functionality implemented. The remaining subtasks (3.9-3.10) and subsequent tasks (4-6) can be implemented in future sessions to complete the full Harbor replicator application.
