## Implementation Patterns

[2025-06-11 18:59:48] - **Synchronization Engine Implementation Patterns**

### 1. Interface Segregation Pattern
**Pattern**: Separate interfaces for each major concern (WorkerPool, Scheduler, Orchestrator, etc.)
**Benefits**: Clean dependencies, easier testing, flexible implementations
**Usage**: Each component depends only on interfaces it needs, enabling mock implementations for testing

### 2. Worker Pool Pattern
**Pattern**: Configurable worker pool with job queue and result collection
**Implementation**: 
- Bounded job queue with configurable size
- Worker goroutines with lifecycle management
- Rate limiting with golang.org/x/time/rate
- Graceful shutdown with context cancellation
**Benefits**: Controlled concurrency, back-pressure handling, resource management

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Pattern**: Per-resource circuit breakers to handle remote service failures
**States**: Closed (normal), Open (failing), Half-Open (testing recovery)
**Implementation**: Configurable failure thresholds, timeout periods, and success criteria
**Benefits**: Prevents cascading failures, automatic recovery, fail-fast behavior

### 4. Observer Pattern for Progress Tracking
**Pattern**: Channel-based subscriptions for real-time progress updates
**Implementation**: Progress channels per sync operation, subscription management, cleanup on completion
**Benefits**: Real-time monitoring, decoupled progress reporting, efficient resource usage

### 5. Strategy Pattern for Conflict Resolution
**Pattern**: Pluggable conflict resolution strategies (source wins, target wins, merge, etc.)
**Implementation**: Strategy interface with multiple implementations, configurable per resource type
**Benefits**: Flexible conflict handling, policy-driven resolution, extensible strategies

### 6. Lifecycle Management Pattern
**Pattern**: Consistent Start/Stop/Restart pattern across all components
**Implementation**: 
- Context-based cancellation
- WaitGroup for goroutine coordination
- Atomic state management
- Graceful shutdown timeouts
**Benefits**: Predictable lifecycle, clean resource cleanup, coordinated shutdown

### 7. Configuration Pattern
**Pattern**: Hierarchical configuration with defaults and validation
**Structure**: Engine config → Component configs → Feature configs
**Features**: Hot-reload support, validation functions, sensible defaults
**Benefits**: Flexible configuration, operational safety, easy deployment
