# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create Kubernetes Manifests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop complete Kubernetes deployment manifests including Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, and PVC resources
# Details:
Create Kubernetes manifests as specified in PRD:
- Deployment with proper resource limits and health checks
- Service for metrics and health endpoints
- ConfigMap for application configuration
- Secret for Harbor credentials
- PersistentVolumeClaim for state storage

Add additional resources:
```yaml
# ServiceMonitor for Prometheus Operator
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: harbor-replicator
  namespace: harbor
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: harbor-replicator
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    interval: 30s
    path: /metrics
```

Implement Helm chart structure for easier deployment:
```
harbor-replicator/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
└── templates/
    ├── deployment.yaml
    ├── service.yaml
    ├── configmap.yaml
    ├── secret.yaml
    └── pvc.yaml
```

# Test Strategy:
Deploy to test Kubernetes cluster, verify all resources are created correctly, test pod restarts maintain state, verify metrics are scraped by Prometheus
