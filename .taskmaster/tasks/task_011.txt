# Test Strategy:
Test exponential backoff timing, verify non-retryable errors fail immediately, test context cancellation during retry, measure retry performance impact

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Error Categories and Classification System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive error classification system that categorizes errors as retryable (transient) or non-retryable (permanent), including custom error types and interfaces
### Details:
Create error types for: network timeouts, rate limiting, service unavailable (503), database connection errors, authentication failures, validation errors, and business logic errors. Implement an ErrorClassifier interface with methods to determine retry eligibility, extract status codes, and identify error categories. Include error wrapping utilities to preserve context while maintaining classification.

## 2. Implement Enhanced Retry Configuration and Jitter [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Extend the existing RetryConfig to include jitter for avoiding thundering herd, retry predicates, and per-operation customization options
### Details:
Add jitter calculation to prevent synchronized retries across multiple clients. Implement retry predicates that can inspect error types and response codes. Add configuration for retry-after header support, custom backoff strategies (linear, exponential, fibonacci), and operation-specific retry policies. Include context deadline awareness to avoid retrying beyond request timeout.

## 3. Build Circuit Breaker Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create a circuit breaker pattern implementation with configurable thresholds, half-open state testing, and automatic recovery
### Details:
Implement three states: closed (normal operation), open (failing fast), and half-open (testing recovery). Configure failure threshold percentage, minimum request volume, timeout duration, and success threshold for recovery. Use sliding window for tracking request outcomes. Include metrics collection for monitoring circuit state transitions and failure rates.

## 4. Create Partial Failure Recovery Manager [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement mechanisms to handle partial failures in batch operations, including rollback strategies and compensation logic
### Details:
Build a transaction log for tracking partial completions in batch operations. Implement checkpoint-based recovery for resumable operations. Create compensation handlers for reversing partially completed operations. Add support for idempotency keys to prevent duplicate processing during retries. Include progress tracking and partial result aggregation.

## 5. Develop Retry Metrics and Observability [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive metrics collection for retry attempts, circuit breaker states, and error patterns to enable monitoring and alerting
### Details:
Track metrics including: retry attempt counts by error type, retry success/failure rates, circuit breaker state changes and trip reasons, latency impact of retries, and error frequency patterns. Implement OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing of retry chains. Add structured logging with correlation IDs for debugging retry sequences.

## 6. Build Adaptive Retry Strategy Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.5
### Description: Create an intelligent retry system that adapts retry behavior based on historical success rates and system load
### Details:
Implement machine learning-inspired algorithms to adjust retry parameters dynamically. Track success rates per error type and endpoint. Reduce retry aggressiveness during high load periods. Implement token bucket rate limiting for retry attempts. Add priority-based retry queuing for critical operations. Include feedback loops from circuit breaker states to influence retry decisions.

## 7. Create Integration Layer and Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6
### Description: Build HTTP middleware and gRPC interceptors that automatically apply retry logic, circuit breakers, and error handling to all outbound requests
### Details:
Implement HTTP RoundTripper wrapper with automatic retry and circuit breaker integration. Create gRPC unary and streaming interceptors with retry support. Add configuration hot-reloading for runtime adjustment of retry policies. Implement request hedging for latency-sensitive operations. Include distributed circuit breaker coordination using Redis or similar for multi-instance deployments.
