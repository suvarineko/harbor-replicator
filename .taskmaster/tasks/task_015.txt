# Priority: medium
# Description: Write comprehensive documentation including README, API docs, deployment guides, and set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and releases
# Details:
Create documentation:
```markdown
# README.md
# Harbor Registry Replicator

## Overview
Harbor Registry Replicator synchronizes robot accounts and OIDC groups...

## Quick Start
### Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployments/kubernetes/
```

## Configuration
[Detailed configuration guide]

## Monitoring
[Metrics and alerting setup]
```

Create CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yaml):
```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
      with:
        go-version: '1.21'
    - run: make test
    - run: make lint
    - run: make build
    
  integration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      harbor:
        image: goharbor/harbor-core:latest
    steps:
    - run: make integration-test
    
  release:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - run: make docker-build
    - run: make docker-push
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify documentation is accurate and complete, test all code examples work, ensure CI/CD pipeline catches failures, test release process creates proper artifacts
